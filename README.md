# Evaluation of transformation methods of the observed:expected
ratio in multiple imputation settings for validating prediction models

Abstract: Measuring the calibration is essential for validation of clinical prediction models. However, 
missing data is a common issue which can complicate the measurement of calibration
statistics like the observed:expected (O/E) ratio. By performing a simulation study, this work
investigates whether transformations of the O/E ratio improve the performance of the statistic
in settings of missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI). MI replaces missing values
creating multiple different data sets. The O/E statistics are calculated for each imputed data set.
Subsequently, the O/E statistics are pooled according to Rubin’s rules. As Rubin’s rules are
based on asymptotic theory, transformations of the O/E estimates prior to pooling may improve
the performance of the statistic. The simulation study considers the untransformed, natural log,
and square root transformation methods to compare their performance to the true O/E. Performance
is assessed by the measures of bias and coverage probability. Results indicate that none
of the investigated transformation methods is appropriate to improve the performance.
